# Simulation Information

Here you can find detailed information about the simulated videos in the RoCoG-v2 dataset.

Simulation information is provided in the form of XML files (one for gesture parameters and another for scene parameters) for each view (ground, hover, and orbital). We have also consolidated this information into CSV files, where each row corresponds to a video in the dataset and lists the full set of gesture and scene parameters for that video.
